# Part 1: Basics

These are basic tutorials for constructing map content (web pages) using SVGMap.js.

The basic tutorials consist entirely of static files (content). No coding of web applications using JavaScript will be undertaken.

Furthermore, no DBMS or GIS server engine will be installed on the server side (Note that the absence of dynamic elements on the server side also applies to the [WebApp Layer tutorial](.)).
